  headword line – At the core of each entry is a headword line, which lists the headword in bold,
  often followed by basic grammar and orthography details, e.g. gender, inflected forms, alternate
  orthography in languages with multiple orthographies like Japanese, Korean and Serbian. Some editors
  use the phrase inflection line instead.

https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Entry_layout_explained/POS_headers
  The headers in an entry (or nested within an etymology section) should always be in (English) alphabetical order,
  except that non-POS headers describing characters or syllables should come first.

Debated POS level 3 headers
Header 	Category 	Notes
Number 	(e.g.) Kurdish numbers 	No consensus has been reached on which of these six headers should be used or the category names.
Cardinal number 	(e.g.) French cardinal numbers 	Should be Number or Numeral with {{cardinal}} on the definition lines as appropriate. (?)
Ordinal number 	(e.g.) French ordinal numbers 	Should be Number or Numeral with {{ordinal}} on the definition lines as appropriate. (?)
Numeral 	(e.g.) German numerals 	
Cardinal numeral 	(e.g.) French cardinal numbers 	
Ordinal numeral 	(e.g.) French ordinal numbers 	

Note that a number of languages have these categories named inconsistently. Not all cardinal numbers function grammatically as cardinal numbers, and not all forms of ordinal numbers are words (some are abbreviations or symbols), hence the topical categories as subcategories under Mathematics. The safest route is to use Category:fr:Cardinal numbers as a topical category, with Category:French numerals or Category:French numbers as the POS category containing the subcategories for specific kinds of numbers.
Other headers in use

These headers are usually language specific. (Some may be moved to standard or deprecated later, or left here as language specific.) Mostly these are not POS, but other level 3 headers used as is Symbol for individual letters, characters, or for CJKV languages, syllables and readings. (Other headers in use may be added to this table regardless of the warning above note to modify this policy page without a vote; the appearance of a header in this table is not strict policy.)
